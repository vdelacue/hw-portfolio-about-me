                            <p>When you are little, you are often asked:</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>“What do you want to be when you grow up?”</p>

                            <p>Of course this answer changes as we get older you go from shouting “A princess!

                            <p>Why not choose something more safe, with job security and a clearly marked road. For me,
                                my answers seemed to want chaotic, dangerous, and unstable (in a good way?). My answers
                                changed every few years from 1981-2015, every response more different than the next.</p>

                            <p>Throughout my life I have been fearless about diving head first into professions I had
                                little experience and/or little knowledge about. My motto was I could fake it till I
                                make it. I thought I would learn with onsite training and experience coupled with self
                                discipline. In some instances that was true, not so much for others but that is a topic
                                for another post. My Resume if I were to write it all out is all over the map without
                                any <em>apparent</em> concentration in one area. I was a:</p>

                            <p>At this point you must think I’m either 100 years old, Don Quixote’s female counter part,
                                crazy or a grifter. I’d like to think I’m a <em>healthy</em> combination of the last
                                two. So to make a long story longer, after spending a lifetime working in different
                                professions, I finally took the plunge to pursue my true passion, are you ready …
                                Programming/computer science/developer (call it what you want) the field is TECHNOLOGY!
                                In October 2015 I quit my job and enrolled in <a href="https://www.bloc.io/"
                                    target="_blank">Bloc.io</a> software engineering track.</p>

                            <p>I stated above that I finally found my calling in programming, and I know it sounds like
                                just another dot in my lists of professions soon to be followed by another in the minds
                                of you skeptics BUT! I say Nay! There is one profession all encompassing that touches
                                every single profession in the world. Technology and Computers! No matter where you work
                                or in what you work, programming is right there doing something. With a strong
                                foundation in programming and software engineering I could use all the skills I have
                                amassed during my professional journey and put them to use.</p>

                            <p>It was clear I was destined to be in the world of technology. As a programmer or software
                                developer I can work in any all professional worlds. I can build apps that use virtual
                                reality to treat patients with Panic Attacks or Generalized Anxiety Disorders. I can
                                develop technology that attaches to a pool cue and adjusts your stroke while teaching
                                you how adjusting your speed and where you hit the cueball will affect the object ball.
                                I can create interactive and professional sites for bands/artists that go viral and
                                design electronic press kits that attract major labels. I can collaborate with financial
                                institutions to develop securities software and evaluate how much money someone may need
                                in retirement. I can create electronic medical records and evaluation templates that
                                become industry standards in psychiatric facilities. The possibilities in each
                                profession I have worked in are endless with programming. That is how I know, this
                                perpetual professional has found her final profession. A profession that opens the
                                enitre world to me and any where I want to go.</p>

                            <p>I would like to end on a very important note, I don’t care if you’re 5 or 105 Never give
                                up on chasing and doing what you love. The journey you take will lead you to what you
                                really want to do, trust your gut. There is nothing in the world like waking up and
                                loving your job, never give up on being able to do something you love.</p>

                            <p>Each one of my professions has lead me to discover and help me to develop my passion for
                                computers and programming. with each job there was a spark that grew into a roaring fire
                                inside of me! A curiosity and insatiable thirst for wanting to be able to do, develop
                                and create anything I desired through applications, software and websites that touched
                                on all my professions from the past and soon my future.</p>
