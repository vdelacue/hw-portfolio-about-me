                        <p>Throughout my life I have been fearless about diving head first into professions I had little
                            experience and/or little knowledge about.
                            My motto was I could fake it till I make it. I thought I would learn with onsite training
                            and experience coupled with self discipline.
                            In some instances that was true, not so much for others but that is a topic for another
                            post.
                            My Resume if I were to write it all out is all over the map without any apparent
                            concentration in one area. I was a:

                            At this point you must think I’m either 100 years old, Don Quixote’s female counter part,
                            crazy or a grifter. I’d like to think I’m a healthy combination of the last two. So to make
                            a long story longer, after spending a lifetime working in different professions, I finally
                            took the plunge to pursue my true passion, are you ready … Programming/computer
                            science/developer (call it what you want) the field is TECHNOLOGY! In October 2015 I quit my
                            job and enrolled in Bloc.io software engineering track.

                            I stated above that I finally found my calling in programming, and I know it sounds like
                            just another dot in my lists of professions soon to be followed by another in the minds of
                            you skeptics BUT! I say Nay! There is one profession all encompassing that touches every
                            single profession in the world. Technology and Computers! No matter where you work or in
                            what you work, programming is right there doing something. With a strong foundation in
                            programming and software engineering I could use all the skills I have amassed during my
                            professional journey and put them to use.

                            It was clear I was destined to be in the world of technology. As a programmer or software
                            developer I can work in any all professional worlds. I can build apps that use virtual
                            reality to treat patients with Panic Attacks or Generalized Anxiety Disorders. I can develop
                            technology that attaches to a pool cue and adjusts your stroke while teaching you how
                            adjusting your speed and where you hit the cueball will affect the object ball. I can create
                            interactive and professional sites for bands/artists that go viral and design electronic
                            press kits that attract major labels. I can collaborate with financial institutions to
                            develop securities software and evaluate how much money someone may need in retirement. I
                            can create electronic medical records and evaluation templates that become industry
                            standards in psychiatric facilities. The possibilities in each profession I have worked in
                            are endless with programming. That is how I know, this perpetual professional has found her
                            final profession. A profession that opens the enitre world to me and any where I want to go.

                            I would like to end on a very important note, I don’t care if you’re 5 or 105 Never give up
                            on chasing and doing what you love. The journey you take will lead you to what you really
                            want to do, trust your gut. There is nothing in the world like waking up and loving your
                            job, never give up on being able to do something you love.

                            Each one of my professions has lead me to discover and help me to develop my passion for
                            computers and programming. with each job there was a spark that grew into a roaring fire
                            inside of me! A curiosity and insatiable thirst for wanting to be able to do, develop and
                            create anything I desired through applications, software and websites that touched on all my
                            professions from the past and soon my future.</p>
